# SM_BillingSystem
This program implements a basic shopping system with admin and buyer interfaces. Admins can add, edit, and delete products, while buyers can view products and generate receipts. Product data is stored in a file. The `shopping` class manages operations, and the `menu` method provides navigation through the system's functionalities.
