# SM_BillingSystem
This program implements a simple shopping system with an administrator and a buyer interface. The `shopping` class contains methods for the administrator to add, edit, and delete products from a database, while the buyer can view a list of products and generate a receipt for purchased items. The menu system facilitates navigation through the various options, with appropriate input handling and file operations to manage product information.
